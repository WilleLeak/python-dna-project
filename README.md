# python-dna-project
project for python class (i have no knowledge of biology)

NOTE: CODE IS OPTIMIZED FOR WINDOWS DISPLAYS! GUI LOOKS WEIRD/DRAWING NOT DISPLAYING PROPERLY ON MAC DISPLAYS! I DONT KNOW WHY! ALL FEATURES ARE STILL PRESENT THOUGH.
  quick fix found for mac devices: 
  
    in global variables, change windowSizeX to 700 and windowSizeY to 850 (im pretty sure mac pixel densities are different than pc monitor pixel densities so the display draws weird bc of that)
      

has features such as:
  - a useable GUI! (wow so cool)
  - translating dna to mrna
  - creating a complementary sequence of dna
  - translating a sequence to its amino acids
  - calculating gc content
  - finding all six reading frames of a dna sequence
  - finding the OPEN reading frames of a dna sequence
  - information on what a reading frame is and how do make one by hand if you wanted to
  - finds n length kmers, reverse complement nkmers, and a canonical kmer
    - for kmers it finds total count, distinct count, unique count
    - for canonical kmers, it finds total count, distinct count, unique count
  - information on what a kmer is and other facts/knowledge
