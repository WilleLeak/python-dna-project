# python-dna-project
project for python class (i have no knowledge of biology)

has features such as:
  - a useable GUI! (wow so cool)
  - translating dna to mrna
  - creating a complementary sequence of dna
  - translating a sequence to its amino acids
  - calculating gc content
  - finding all six reading frames of a dna sequence
  - finding the OPEN reading frames of a dna sequence
  - information on what a reading frame is and how do make one by hand if you wanted to
  - finds n length kmers, reverse complement nkmers, and a canonical kmer
    - for kmers it finds total count, distinct count, unique count
    - for canonical kmers, it finds total count, distinct count, unique count
  - information on what a kmer is and other facts/knowledge
